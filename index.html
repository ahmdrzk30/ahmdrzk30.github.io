          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p align="justify">
            My name is Ahmad Rizki, and this is my simple portofolio website
            that mostly around Data Analytics. This minimal design is inspired
            by one of my best friends'
            <a href="https://ilyasabdut.github.io/">portofolio page</a>. I made
            this website as simple as possible because what I wanted to show is
            the result of the analytics process and maybe a little information
            about how I get them.<br />
            Thank you.

          <p>1. Daily Customers for December 2019</p>
          <p align="justify">
            Description : This is a case study from DQLab about a company that
            wanted to know how the sales projected for December 2019. The data
            was processed using Python and using Matplotlib to show the result
            on Visual Studio Code. The line plot was chosen, because it can show
            the day-to-day sales better.
          </p>

      <div class="row row-cols-2">
        <div class="col">
          <p align="justify">
            From the line plot, we know that the highest number of customers was
            on December 1st. That can be caused by many people getting prepared
            for Christmas. While the lowest number of customers was around
            Christmas, and people choose to stay at home with family and
            friends.<br /><br />
            The possible next step that can be taken is analyzing what kind of
            products sold around the hightest volume of customer, so the company
            the bring more of the same products around the said time. Another
            possible step is to analyzing how many customers in certain provinces.

            After processing the data by using Python and plot them into bar chart,
            we can see that DKI Jakarta has the highest number of customers that bought
            products from the company. Which means, as the nation's capital, DKI Jakarta
            is indeed high in products consumption's rate.<br /><br />
